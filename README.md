# Gravity-Model-Telecom
This is a repository that contains code used for my project to implement the Gravity Model to predict telecom flow between cities.

The base of this code is based on the paper, Urban gravity: a model for inter-city telecommunication flows, by Gautier Krings et.al. 
We then edit this code to add the variable of GDP for a more accurate model.

Type the following into python to install all dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
To run all the scripts together, you can use the run_workflow file by running in Terminal: python src/run_workflow.py
